Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.


Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.
